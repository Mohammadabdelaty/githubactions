# Github Actions Study

This is a simple toturial, and study of how github actions work.

This readme is a study note and it is going to be inhanced and updated periodecally.

* Some commits were due accessing git from wsl and vscode:
    you need to add your git path `/usr/bin/git` into `git.path` -search for it in vscode settings-

Generally you can specify the branch you want your workflow to run in. Also, depends on specific change in specific dir no the whol git repo.

## On push
`on.push:`
Only after pushing the changes

## Scheduled workflow
`on.schedule:`
It's used to scheduel a specific workflow not related to any action: soething like checking the code or generating a report periodecally.

But, from the next screenshot it seems it is not repeat the scheduled job befor less than 10 minutes.

I'm truning it to run once a year.
"0 0 1 1 *"

## Manual Workflow
`on.workflow_dispatch:`
Could be push button, api call, or some other things.

You can also run it with gh cli command. 
Here I'm using ubunut24.04 WSL:

```bash
sudo apt install gh
gh auth login
## Follow the steps then enter the code to verifiy you identity.

# Run the workflow
gh workflow run "Manual workflow"
âœ“ Created workflow_dispatch event for manual.yml at main

To see runs for this workflow, try: gh run list --workflow=manual.yml

gh run list --workflow=manual.yml
```
